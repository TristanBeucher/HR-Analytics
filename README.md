Predicting and explaining the resignation of the best employees of a virtual company ?

Attrition is defined as "The unpredictable and uncontrollable, but normal, reduction of work force due to resignations, retirement, sickness, or death." (http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/attrition.html)

Ever wanted to understand why people resign, especially when they are among the best employees of their company ? Thank to a Kaggle dataset (not available anymore on Kaggle), attrition could be predicted and maybe explained.

Unfortunately, the data in this dataset are just simulated data.
